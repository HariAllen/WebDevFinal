# The best I could do. 
# As a heads up: I tried opening it regularly, and the link to the second page works, but the variables I tried to send to the second page(index2) did not work,
# so checking the checkboxes doesn't actually show up in the second page. The other issue that arised was with flask, where the first page(index) works just find,
# but the second doesn't show up, and I couldn't figure out how to make it work or show the pictures. This was the best I could do.
